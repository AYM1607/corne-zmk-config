# 1.0.0

- Designed with Colemak DHm layout to be used on Windows
- Use AHK for Unicode sequences because buggy results with ZMK
- ZMK does not support assigning the same keys as combos while being used for home rows
- Added AHK layer change notifications
- Added accents, JS/TS shortcuts with ZMK and AHK
- AHK shortcuts use <kbd>win</kbd>+<kbd>‚å•</kbd> or <kbd>win</kbd>+<kbd>^</kbd> to avoid previous shortcuts collisions
