# 1.0.0

- Designed with Colemak DHm layout to be used on Windows
- Use AHK for unicode sequences because buggy results with ZMK
- ZMK does not support assign same keys as combos while been used for home rows
- Added AHK layer change notifications
- Added accents, JS/TS shortcuts with ZMK and AHK
- AHK shortcuts use win+alt or win+ctrl to avoid previous shortcuts collisions
